# Mongo-Scraper
All the News That's Fit to Scrape

Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

Instructions


Create an app that accomplishes the following:


Whenever a user visits your site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet of your choice and display them for the user. Each scraped article should be saved to your application database. At a minimum, the app should scrape and display the following information for each article:


 * Headline - the title of the article

 * Summary - a short summary of the article

 * URL - the url to the original article

 * Feel free to add more content to your database (photos, bylines, and so on).

Users should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments should be saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.

Benny's explanation: This application will scrape or "get" information from the new york times website. It will then load all this information into a database. User can then click any article to save, they can click on the "saved article" button and it will bring up the articles they saved. They can delete the article out of the saved section or leaves notes. Each note can be saved and multiple notes can be added for future reference. These notes can also be deleted.
